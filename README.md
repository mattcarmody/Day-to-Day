# Day-to-Day
Little things I do at home made easier with the aid of Python.

# leveler.py
Flattens out a directory tree. Files in subdirectories are moved to the given base directory.

# spgMin.py
Credit card bonuses usually require a minimum spend within a given time frame. This script tracks credit card spending via automated emails from American Express, recording all purchases in a spreadsheet and printing the amount spent to date in the terminal. Instead of logging in to AMEX and mentally tallying purchases since a particular date, I can run this script in the terminal and be notified of my progress!
