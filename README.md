# Day-to-Day
Little things I do at home made easier with the aid of Python.

# leveler.py
Flattens out a directory tree. Files in subdirectories are moved to the given base directory.

# spgMin.py
Credit card bonuses usually require a minimum spend within a given time frame. 
This script tracks credit card spending via automated emails from American Express, recording all purchases in a spreadsheet and printing the amount spent to date in the terminal. 
Instead of logging in to AMEX and mentally tallying purchases since a particular date, I can run this script in the terminal and be notified of my progress!

# winTheMorning.py
I've found that starting my day in a positive, productive way makes a world of difference over the course of the entire day. 
This script is run every morning (with cron) and serves as my alarm clock. 
It sets the computer to full volume and launches a YouTube video of my choice that sets the tone for my morning.
